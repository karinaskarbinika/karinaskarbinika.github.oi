      I am First-year UXD student at The Hague University of Applied Sciences. 
      With a background in UX design, I have learned to work with  Adobe XD, Processing, 
      and Adobe Lightroom. Currently, I am learning how to create content in Visual Studio Code for HTML/CSS 
      websites. I am excited to start working closely with clients to understand their needs and create 
      designs that truly reflect their brand. My goal is to create visually stunning and user-friendly 
      designs that effectively communicate a client's message. If you're interested in working with me 
      on a project or have any questions, please feel free to contact me through my email or Instagram profile.

       <h4 class="text">This programming project utilizes Processing, 
        a programming language and development environment, to create a 
        game where users must catch a ball in a basket. The objective of 
        the game is to catch the ball as many times as possible in the 
        moving basket. The game gets harder as the user catches the ball 
        more times and the speed of the basket increases. To make the 
        game more challenging, the background is moving in a way that makes
         it hard to focus on the game. The ball is black which allows users 
         with color blindness to play the game, however, it can be challenging
          for people who cannot look at a moving screen for a long time. 
          To help players keep track of their progress, a score board is 
          displayed on top of the game screen. The baskets have been designed 
          with a darker tone to make it easier for players to understand where 
          the ball should be thrown.</h4>

      Have you ever considered the excitement of bonding over a meal 
      or exploring a museum with a complete stranger? The "Find Your 
      People for the Day" touchscreen in the city center makes it easy 
      to connect with others who share similar interests. By creating a 
      profile and setting a goal for the day, such as searching for a 
      companion to dine at a Chinese restaurant or join in a basketball game, 
      individuals can easily connect with one another. The contacts and 
      information about users are on the screen. (As a designer, my priority
       is to provide a secure platform for users to comfortably expand their 
       social circles. To ensure safety, the touchscreen requires ID 
       verification before use, eliminating the risk of any unsavory situations.)

      <h3 class="projectname3">"EXPLORE THE WORLD" - LIFE LONG PROJECT</h3>
      <h4 class="text2">This photography project is a personal journey for me - the photographer, 
        who wants to create a life-long photo album chronicling their craziest experiences. I plan 
        to capture candid and raw moments that truly represent the wild and unpredictable nature 
        of life. The images will not only showcase my personal experiences but also provide a glimpse 
        into the world of adventure and excitement. The project will be a visual storybook, where each 
        photograph tells a unique and thrilling tale. I will use various techniques such as long exposures,
         panoramas, and creative compositions to create striking and dynamic images. This project is not
         just about taking pictures, but about preserving memories and sharing them with others. The
          final product will be a curated collection of photographs that will be cherished for years to come.
